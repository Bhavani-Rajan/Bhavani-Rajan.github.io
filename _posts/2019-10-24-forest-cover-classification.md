## Goal
  Predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables only
	(no remotely sensed data).

## The Data
  The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) 
  was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System 
(RIS) data.  Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from 
  US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data.  Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains
binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types).
  
  The study area included four wilderness areas found in 
	the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.  A total 
	of twelve cartographic measures were utilized as independent 
	variables in the predictive models, while seven major forest 
	cover types were used as dependent variables.  Several subsets 
	of these variables were examined to determine the best overall 
	predictive model. 
## Feature information

## Summary

The map clearly shows the rise of this disease in south eastern and few regions of eastern United States compared to the other parts of United States.
